# Real-time Ray Tracing

My final project submitted at the University of East Anglia.

The goal of this project was to research and implement a real-time ray tracer on consumer-level hardware.

This repository includes all the code and a 53 page technical report.

Notable features:

  - Shadows, Relfections and Refractions
  - Schlick's approximation
  - Surface Area Heuristic KD-Tree
  - Diffuse, Specular and Bump Mapping
  - GPU Parallel Processing using CUDA
